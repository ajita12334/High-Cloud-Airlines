To explore and visualize airline operational data, focusing on passenger load factors, route efficiency, carrier performance, and distance-based flight groupings. The analysis helps in making data-driven business decisions.

# ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL:** Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation (joins, date creation, KPIs).
- **Excel:** Data cleaning, VLOOKUPs, pivot tables, calculated columns.
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard creation with slicers, bar/line/pie charts.
- **Tableau:** Advanced visual storytelling and interactive analytics dashboards.

# ðŸ“Œ Case Study Questions Solved

- **Date Dimensions Created:**
   Year, Month No, Month Name, Quarter, Year-Month, Weekday No, Weekday Name, Financial Month, Financial Quarter.
